    <h2 id="chapter1">Background:</h2>
    <p>My background has been anything but linear. I graduated from UMass Amherst two years ago
        with a degree in kinesiology on the pre-med track. Since then I have worked in finance
        at a large investment bank called <a href="https://fa.morganstanley.com/karelitzgroup/index.htm" target="_blank">
        Morgan Stanley</a>, and I have worked in sales for a startup
        called OpsGenie. Although I do not want to pursue a career in finance or sales, I learned 
        a lot from my professional experiences and am grateful that it helped bring me to where 
        I am now. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="chapter2">Interest in Programming:</h3>
    <p>Toward the end of college I knew I wanted to work in some field of engineering. I like
        working on projects, solving problems, and using computers. I spent a lot of time on
        the internet looking at career paths trying to figure out what would be right for me.
        Everything I found seemed to point to software. Software is used in our everyday lives and 
        it is basically taking over the world. I knew a few kids who were programmers, some with a
        CS degree and others who went to bootcamps. They gave me a few websites to practice on
        (for example <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>), and
        after playing around on those sites for a few months I applied to Coding Temple. It can
        definitely be frustrating and it will be difficult to learn, but it seems that once you
        get the hang of it the possibilities will be endless.
